The Firebase authentication process has changed and now differs from Rahul's instructions.

The instructions are so difficult I can't follow them and I have to give up here.
Instructions:
Menu - Tools - Firebase
Under Authentication, select "Authenticate using Google [KOTLIN]"
I'm stuck at Step 4: Integrate Google sign-in into your app
